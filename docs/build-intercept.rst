========================
Build & I/O Interception
========================

In this section, we describe how to build UnifyFS with I/O interception.

.. note::

    The current version of UnifyFS adopts the mdhim key-value store, which strictly
    requires:

    "An MPI distribution that supports MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE and per-object locking of
    critical sections (this excludes OpenMPI up to version 3.0.1, the current version as of this writing)"

    as specified in the project `github <https://github.com/mdhim/mdhim-tng>`_.

---------------------------------------
UnifyFS Build Configuration Options
---------------------------------------

Fortran
*******

To enable UnifyFS use with Fortran applications, pass the ``--enable-fortran``
option to configure. Note that only GCC Fortran (i.e., gfortran) is known to
work with UnifyFS. There is an open
`ifort_issue <https://github.com/LLNL/UnifyFS/issues/300>`_ with the Intel
Fortran compiler as well as an
`xlf_issue <://github.com/LLNL/UnifyFS/issues/304>`_ with the IBM Fortran
compiler.

GOTCHA
******

GOTCHA is the preferred method for I/O interception with UnifyFS, but it is not
available on all platforms. If GOTCHA is not available on your target system,
you can omit it during UnifyFS configuration by using the ``--without-gotcha``
configure option. Without GOTCHA, static linker wrapping is required for I/O
interception.

PMI2/PMIx Key-Value Store
*************************

When available, UnifyFS uses the distributed key-value store capabilities
provided by either PMI2 or PMIx. To enable this support, pass either
the ``--enable-pmi`` or ``--enable-pmix`` option to configure. Without
PMI support, a distributed file system accessible to all servers is required.

Transparent Mounting for MPI Applications
*****************************************

MPI applications written in C or C++ may take advantage of the UnifyFS transparent
mounting capability. With transparent mounting, calls to ``unifyfs_mount()`` and
``unifyfs_unmount()`` are automatically performed during ``MPI_Init()`` and
``MPI_Finalize()``, respectively. Transparent mounting always uses ``/unifyfs`` as
the namespace mountpoint. To enable transparent mounting, use the
``--enable-mpi-mount`` configure option.

HDF5
****

UnifyFS includes example programs that use HDF5. If HDF5 is not available on
your target system, it can be omitted during UnifyFS configuration by using
the ``--without-hdf5`` configure option.

---------------------------
Building UnifyFS with Spack
---------------------------

Full Build
**********

To install all dependencies and set up your build environment, we recommend
using the `Spack package manager <https://github.com/spack/spack>`_. If you
already have Spack, make sure you have the latest release or if using a clone
of their develop branch, ensure you have pulled the latest changes.

.. _build-label:

Install Spack
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: Bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/spack/spack
    $ # optionally create a packages.yaml specific to your machine
    $ . spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh

Make use of Spack's `shell support <https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#add-spack-to-the-shell>`_
to automatically add Spack to your ``PATH`` and allow the use of the ``spack``
command.

Install UnifyFS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: Bash

    $ spack install unifyfs
    $ spack load unifyfs

If the most recent changes on the development branch ('dev') of UnifyFS are
desired, then do ``spack install unifyfs@develop``.

.. Edit the following admonition if the default of variants are changed or when
   new variants are added.

Include or remove variants with Spack when installing UnifyFS when a custom
build is desired. Type ``spack info unifyfs`` for more info.

.. table:: UnifyFS Build Variants
   :widths: auto

   ==========  ========================================  ===========================
      Variant  Command                                   Description
   ==========  ========================================  ===========================
   Auto-mount  ``spack install unifyfs+auto-mount``      Enable transparent mounting
   HDF5        ``spack install unifyfs+hdf5``            Build with parallel HDF5

               ``spack install unifyfs+hdf5 ^hdf5~mpi``  Build with serial HDF5
   Fortran     ``spack install unifyfs+fortran``         Enable Fortran support
   PMI         ``spack install unifyfs+pmi``             Enable PMI2 support
   PMIx        ``spack install unifyfs+pmix``            Enable PMIx support
   ==========  ========================================  ===========================

.. attention::

    The initial install could take a while as Spack will install build
    dependencies (autoconf, automake, m4, libtool, and pkg-config) as well as
    any dependencies of dependencies (cmake, perl, etc.) if you don't already
    have these dependencies installed through Spack or haven't told Spack where
    they are locally installed on your system (i.e., through a custom
    `packages.yaml <https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_settings.html#external-packages>`_).
    Type ``spack spec -I unifyfs`` before installing to see what Spack is going
    to do.

---------------------------

Manual Build
************

Optionally, you can install the dependencies with Spack and still build UnifyFS
manually. This is useful if wanting to be able to edit the UnifyFS source code
between builds, but still letting Spack take care of the dependencies.  Take
advantage of
`Spack Environments <https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environments.html>`_
to streamline this process.

.. _spack-build-label:

Build the Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once Spack is installed on your system (see :ref:`above <build-label>`), the
UnifyFS dependencies can then be installed.

.. code-block:: Bash

    $ spack install flatcc
    $ spack install gotcha
    $ spack install leveldb
    $ spack install margo ^mercury+bmi

.. tip::

    You can use ``spack install --only=dependencies unifyfs`` to install all of
    UnifyFS's dependencies without installing UnifyFS.

    Keep in mind this will also install all the build dependencies and
    dependencies of dependencies if you haven't already installed them through
    Spack or told Spack where they are locally installed on your system via a
    `packages.yaml <https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_settings.html#external-packages>`_.

Build UnifyFS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Download the latest UnifyFS release from the `Releases
<https://github.com/LLNL/UnifyFS/releases>`_ page or clone the develop branch
from the `UnifyFS repository <https://github.com/LLNL/UnifyFS>`_.

Once the dependencies are installed, load them into your environment and then
manually build UnifyFS from inside the source code directory.

.. code-block:: Bash

    $ spack load flatcc
    $ spack load gotcha
    $ spack load leveldb
    $ spack load mercury
    $ spack load argobots
    $ spack load margo
    $
    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install
    $ make
    $ make install

To see all available build configuration options, type ``./configure --help``
after ``./autogen.sh`` has been run.

---------------------------

-------------------------------
Building UnifyFS with Autotools
-------------------------------

Download the latest UnifyFS release from the `Releases
<https://github.com/LLNL/UnifyFS/releases>`_ page or clone the develop branch
from the `UnifyFS repository <https://github.com/LLNL/UnifyFS>`_.

Build the Dependencies
**********************

UnifyFS requires MPI, LevelDB, GOTCHA, FlatCC, Margo and OpenSSL.
References to these dependencies can be found on our :doc:`<dependencies>` page.

A `bootstrap.sh <https://github.com/LLNL/UnifyFS/blob/dev/bootstrap.sh>`_ script
has been provided in order to make manual build and installation of dependencies
easier. Simply run the script in the top level directory of the source code.

.. code-block:: Bash

    $ ./bootstrap.sh

Build UnifyFS
*************

After bootstrap.sh is finished building the dependencies, it will print out the
commands you need to run to build UnifyFS.  The commands look something like
this:

.. code-block:: Bash

    $ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=path/to/mercury/lib/pkgconfig:path/to/argobots/lib/pkgconfig:path/to/margo/lib/pkgconfig
    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install --with-gotcha=/path/to/gotcha --with-leveldb=/path/to/leveldb  --with-flatcc=/path/to/flatcc
    $ make
    $ make install

To see all available build configuration options, type ``./configure --help``
after ``./autogen.sh`` has been run.

---------------------------
I/O Interception
---------------------------

POSIX calls can be intercepted via the methods described below.

Statically
**************

Steps for static linking using --wrap:

To intercept I/O calls using a static link, you must add flags to your link
line. UnifyFS installs a unifyfs-config script that returns those flags, e.g.,

.. code-block:: Bash

    $ mpicc -o test_write \
          `<unifyfs>/bin/unifyfs-config --pre-ld-flags` \
          test_write.c \
          `<unifyfs>/bin/unifyfs-config --post-ld-flags`

Dynamically
**************

Steps for dynamic linking using gotcha:

To intercept I/O calls using gotcha, use the following syntax to link an
application.

C
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: Bash

    $ mpicc -o test_write test_write.c \
        -I<unifyfs>/include -L<unifycy>/lib -lunifyfs_gotcha \
        -L<gotcha>/lib64 -lgotcha

Fortran
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: Bash

    $ mpif90 -o test_write test_write.F \
        -I<unifyfs>/include -L<unifycy>/lib -lunifyfsf -lunifyfs_gotcha
